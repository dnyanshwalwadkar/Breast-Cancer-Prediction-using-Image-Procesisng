# Machine Learning Algorithms For Breast Cancer Prediction And Diagnosis
Each year number of deaths is increasing extremely because of breast cancer. It is the most frequent type of all cancers and the major cause of death in women worldwide. Any development for prediction and diagnosis of cancer disease is capital important for a healthy life. Consequently, high accuracy in cancer prediction is important to update the treatment aspect and the survivability standard of patients. Machine learning techniques can bring a large contribute on the process of prediction and early diagnosis of breast cancer, became a research hotspot and has been proved as a strong technique.

## Introduction
Breast cancer has now overtaken lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide,
according to statistics released by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in December 2020. In
the past two decades, the overall number of people diagnosed with cancer nearly doubled, from an estimated 10
million in 2000 to 19.3 million in 2020 [1]. Today, one in 5 people worldwide will develop cancer during their
lifetime. Projections suggest that the number of people being diagnosed with cancer will increase still further in the
coming years, and will be nearly 50% higher in 2040 than in 2020. The number of cancer deaths has also increased,
from 6.2 million in 2000 to 10 million in 2020. More than one in six deaths is due to cancer.
